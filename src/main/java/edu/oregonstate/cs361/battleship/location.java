 * Created by River Hendriksen on 1/30/17.
 * After trials and fustration I realized that in order for start and end to look pretty there must be an object for them.
 * does that make sense? probably not, but no one really needs to edit this beside me. all this does is order the lists for start and
 * end so they fit the model that was given as an example.
